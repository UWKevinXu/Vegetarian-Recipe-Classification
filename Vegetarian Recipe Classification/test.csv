21,"Shanghai Spring Rolls (Or Egg Rolls)","When I had my restaurant my customers said these were the best they ever had. The recipe is adapted from ""The Chinese Menu Cookbook"" by Joanne Hush and Peter Wong.  In case anyone is interested, the difference between an egg roll and a spring roll is the wrapper. Spring rolls use a very light, delicate wrapper that requires a lot of care to keep from getting holes poked in it. Egg roll wrappers are an egg noodle dough, exactly the same as wonton wrappers but larger in size. This filling can be used with either. The secret is to squeeze out the moisture after cooling so it doesn't soak through the wrapper during deep frying. They should be deep fried at relatively cool temperature (325° - 350°F) until about half cooked. Then either refrigerate or freeze until ready to serve. Finish the deep frying at 375; this double process insures a well cooked, hot inside with a golden brown crispy outside. (Defrost if frozen). Warning: use only raw pork, chicken and shrimp or you will be very disappointed with the results. It's tempting to buy cooked TT shrimp but resist the temptation!","['pork', 'chicken breast half', 'raw small shrimp', 'cabbage', 'dried chinese mushrooms', 'scallions', 'chicken stock', 'salt', 'dry sherry', 'sugar', 'vegetable oil', 'cornstarch', 'sesame oil', 'egg', 'egg roll wraps']",15

This dish is easy and very healthy, and always receives raves from family and friends. The original recipe called for 6 Tbsp. of olive oil, but I found it too oily; feel free to experiment on your own.

Cheesey and smokey works so well together in a rich tomato sauce:D  Regina Schrambling says ""starch is comfort"" and ""cheese is seduction"" and when they're combined the result is pure pleasure.  BF and I have to agree wholeheartedly.  I can usually only find crushed tomatoes in puree, and that worked out very well so I added that as an option.  I am vegetarian so I substituted vegetarian bacon for pancetta.

taken from http://steamykitchen.com/blog/2008/02/19/no-knead-pizza-dough-pear-and-gorgonzola-flatbread-with-baby-arugula-and-shaved-parmesan/

I love the flavor of the dough when it has the chance to chill out in the fridge at least overnight. I also use only half the yeast - the longer you let it sit in the fridge, the less yeast you need to use. So, if I'm looking to make the flatbread same day as I make the dough, I use the full 1 1/2 tbl yeast. If I am making the dough and letting it hang in the fridge, I'll only use half the yeast. Half the yeast will be sufficient when you give it time to do it's thing, and it will taste less ""yeasty.""","['water', 'yeast', 'salt', 'sugar', 'extra virgin olive oil', 'unbleached all-purpose flour']",6

I have made this with both the turkey and the beef and while I liked it both ways, I actually preferred the turkey.

I've made lots of bread using the bread machine, but while they were all decent enough, I've not been able to achieve my ""bread nirvana"".  I think every one that bakes bread has that one awesome special loaf that represents perfection that they strive for, and my desires were for a very soft interior with a nice soft crust, topped with plenty of nice herbs.  I never have been able to make that moist soft bread I've wanted (my previous efforts always came out tough or spongy) until now!

Remember this will only ever be as good as what you serve with it, for veg I like oval radishes and baby carrots, cos or romaine lettuce, celery etc. Try to get freshest you can, if they still have leafy bits on (carrots radishes etc - leave 'em on, they make great handles)

This is delicious, but the recipe makes waaaay too much filling.  They tell you to make 8 rectangles and put 2 Tbsp of filling in each one, which means you only need 16 Tbsp = 1 cup of filling.  Clearly just a pound of asparagus alone makes more than 1 cup.  So... either reduce the filling or plan on having extra for a side dish another night!  Other veggies that are yummy in the filling are zucchini, yellow summer squash and sun dried tomatoes (in oil, drained).   I also found it more convenient to make 6 larger rectangles than 8, which would have been awkwardly shaped, in my opinion.

I hope that others will find it to be as simple, warm, and comforting as I do.","['tomato sauce', 'breadcrumbs', 'cilantro', 'eggs', 'parmesan cheese', 'butternut squash', 'carrots', 'olive oil', 'green onions', 'simply potatoes diced potatoes with onion', 'salt and pepper']",11

Serve with sugar cookies, animal crackers, gingersnaps, apples, pears, cinnamon graham crackers, etc...When choosing your accompaniment, you may want to keep in mind that the dip is pretty sweet on its own.

We also went to private school (same one where my mom taught) so we spent 13 years each in the same place day after day and we really got to know the cafeteria staff well, which was a blessing and a curse, because they watched over us and if we didn't order the hot meal more than once a week, or had soda instead of milk at lunch mom knew and we were in trouble and don't even get me started about the candy bars, (they had been given express orders to not let us buy them!). Wednesday was spaghetti day and they served creamy Italian spinach and garlic bread with it! Everyone in the whole school loved that spinach some kids ate double orders of that and nothing else for lunch. It was a ""secret"" recipe so they wouldn't divulge it to anyone and we only got to have that creamy yummy goodness on Wednesday afternoons. When I was a junior and a senior in highschool, I had last lunch (with 4k-10th going before) and they always ran out of that spinach. My mom mentioned how I liked it so much and was so sad I didn't get there in time to have it anymore and lo and behold from that day on every Wednesday I was presented with a special bowl of spinach they had put aside just for me. They eventually gave the recipe to my mom, we scaled it way down and we don't have spaghetti in our house without it. So enjoy a trip to my elementary, middle and highschool cafeteria.

It is spicy, sweet, tangy and rich all at the same time without being heavy or overly filling.  And it's vegan. How can it be velvety smooth without much in the way of rich coconut milk and absolutely no cream?
It was the addition of the potato that does it. This is a trick she learned when she was cooking for vegan clients as a personal chef.

The host is Devin Alexander and this is her grandmother's recipe, although I did not like the ground cloves in it.  I also wasn't willing to use 2 bunches of fresh parsley, so I use half fresh and half dried.  Serve over whole grain pasta (I recommend brown rice pasta, especially for those not accustomed to whole grain pastas) and with a salad.  I usually cook  quartered crimini mushrooms in 1 cup of sauce for every 2 people or every other week, add baked chicken or turkey meatballs or Hain's spicy chicken sausage (it's lower in sodium than most and can be found at Whole Foods Market).  I also usually have a couple of people over for dinner and freeze the leftover sauce in 1 cup containers, which yields dinner for 4 plus 5 servings for future weeks.  It's necessary to serve cooked tomatoes to men at least once per week since the lycopene reduces their chances of getting prostate cancer.  According to You: The Owner's Manual, ""To absorb the optimum amount [of lycopene] (that is, 400 milligrams per week), you'd have to eat 164 raw tomatoes or 16 cooked ones—but you need only 10 tablespoons of tomato sauce a week.""","['olive oil', 'sweet onion', 'minced garlic cloves', 'crushed tomatoes', 'no-added-salt tomato paste', 'water', 'fresh italian parsley', 'dried parsley', 'turbinado sugar', 'salt', 'dried sweet basil leaves', 'dried bay leaf', 'spaghetti']",13

On thing I did learn, is that if you don't like beef, potatoes or chimichurri ... good luck. It seemed like those 3 ingredients were a part of every meal, but luckily I do like all three.  One night, we had this amazing grilled fish and of course potatoes ... but the appetizers were these simple miniature meatballs with ... of course ... chimichurri.  Well, I am not sure what their recipe was, but the chef was nice enough to tell me that his secret was to add ground pork and a little of the chimichurri to the meatball. Also, theirs was topped with this great tangy cheese.  I never got the name of it, but it is similar to a feta being a drier, crumbly cheese, but the taste of a goat cheese, so I think either one works well.  I tend to use Feta. Well, I ended up using a pretty classic meatball recipe and this is my version.  I make smaller than normal meatballs and just serve with tooth pics on a big platter with the sauce.  They are just Yummy Bite Size appetizers.  A great holiday appetizer and easy to make.  I bake mine, so even healthier.  Make ahead and just reheat.  I also buy Badia Chimichurri sauce, right from the grocery store.

Now if you don't have turkey leftovers (which I almost always do), use chicken which will work just fine. But there is something about the turkey that is just perfect with this. If I don't have leftover turkey, I often buy a small turkey breast just so I can make this soup, and use the rest for sandwiches. And no turkey stock?  ... chicken stock or broth is fine. Just don't skimp on a few things. 1) Sherry wine, 2) REAL wild rice, 3) fresh vegetables and, mushrooms, and; 4) fresh herbs. It just isn't the same otherwise. I can have just a bowl of this for dinner or it makes a great starter, or wonderful with just a salad or grilled sandwich.","['cooked turkey', 'wild rice', 'mushrooms', 'sweet onions', 'leek', 'fennel bulb', 'celery leaves', 'garlic', 'turkey broth', 'sherry wine', 'heavy cream', 'worcestershire sauce', 'bay leaf', 'fresh thyme', 'fresh rosemary', 'fresh parsley', 'butter', 'salt', 'pepper']",19

The key to this pureed soup is the zucchini; it soaks up the flavors of the soup, but doesn't add much taste, also a great way to hide greens from kids. It makes the soup feel softer, fuller somehow, as if cream was added. You don't have to puree it, but I feel that doing so lends a more sophisticated look to it--perfect for a starter if you are having guests. If this is the case, garnishing with chives,  cilantro or thin lemon slices would be delicious and look beautiful.","['olive oil', 'onion', 'garlic clove', 'thyme', 'bay leaf', 'carrots', 'zucchini', 'vegetable stock', 'curry powder', 'salt and pepper']",10

I'll often substitute any fresh fruit we have handy that needs eaten.  Strawberries, Peaches, and blueberries have made a nice medley.

Our crock pot is a small Rival that only has Low, High, and Warm settings.  Low boils over the oatmeal, but warm does it just fine.

NOTES: To toast the pistachios, spread them in a pie plate and bake at 350° for 5 minutes.

WINE: The warm days and cool, foggy nights of the Russian River Valley are a large part of what makes its Pinots so rich in flavor yet also so elegant.

Mixed spice is a blend of sweet spices traditionally used in English cooking to provide a warming backnote. This typically English spice mixture can be purchased ready-mixed, but I prefer to make my own, as I find it difficult to find in France and I have my own special blend. It is essential for fruit cakes, Christmas plum pudding, mincemeat and hot cross buns; mixed spice is also a great addition to other fruity desserts such as apple & fruit pies, crumbles and compotes. Try it in cream cheese desserts, pickles, chutneys and mulled wine too. Make it up and buy the spices needed in small quantities, as the mixture soon loses its full rich flavour. Allspice, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger are the usual blend of spices, but I sometimes like to add a few ground cardamom seeds as well as some ground coriander seeds.

Add to gravies, stuffed veggies, soups, sauces, sprinkle over potatoes, slice and melt on veggie burgers, mix with hot grains, well, you get the idea!
Adapted from the Ultimate Uncheese Cookbook!
A little info on block uncheeses:
Block cheeses are among the most challenging to convert to dairy free versions. This is largely because homemade uncheeses are comparatively low in fat-specifically saturated fat, which stays hard and solid at room temperature. Saturated fat is what keeps dairy cheeses firm, sliceable, and easy to great. Consequently, uncheese blocks generally are much softer than their dairy counterparts and require a lighter touch and more gentle handling when being sliced or grated. One way around this is to freeze uncheese blocks and grate them when they are partially thawed. However, once fully thawed, the texture and consisntency may be altered a bit, depending on the particular cheez. For this reason, it's a good idea to freeze only the amount you know you will be grating and using shortly.
 Melting has been a challenge with uncheeses from the outset. This is why so many maufacturers add dairy derived casein to their uncheese products-it improves meltability and achieves the ""stretch"" that is characteristic of dairy cheese. Fortunately, homemade, dairty free uncheeses will melt, although you might need to nudge them a bit in the process. Covering uncheeses during cooking or baking keeps in heat and moisture and helps promote more even melting. To brown uncheeses after melting, uncover and place under the broiler. Misting with oil will also help to promote better browning and melting.

When simmering agar flakes or powder, be sure the agar is dissolved completely before adding the mixture to the food processor. To soften agar, which will help it dissolve, let it soak in the water for 5-10 minutes before bringing to a boil.

9639,"Oliebollen - the No-Yeast Version.","Warning! The amounts in this recipe are only a guide. This is a recipe I prepare by sight and I know what the batter is supposed to look like. I have taken the amounts from the hieroglyphics scrawled in the margins by my late Dutch mother. This can turn into an all morning production. Mum and Dad used to make these by the hundred and it was a good day for the neighbours to call around for a visit! I make a much smaller amount, just enough to say I have made them for the year. It was the only thing my father ever used to cook and he was in charge of the pot and the actual cooking process. Of course Mum's great recipe made him look good! So each year, I commemorate the old year before welcoming the new, rejoice in a good Dutch tradition, and remember my now late parents and the memory of making and eating these.  I typed this in before New Year and then when I went to make it on New Years Eve I realised that you don't need the butter. And Lord knows there is enough grease from the deep frying process. You do need some sugar but you may be able to get away with about half depending on the apples and amount of sultanas you use. I would start low unless you have a really sweet tooth, make a couple and keep taste testing and adding if necessary. Those first few are always test olliebollen anyway to make sure the oil is at the right temperature. When I say thick batter, I MEAN thick batter. Otherwise the shape becomes rather interesting and they look like amoebae. Do not use crap beer. Those of you in the US, PLEASE use a European beer or a Canadian or downunder one. If you use everyday US beer it will taste horrible. Guiness has worked well for me in the past. This recipe could easily be made vegan if the egg was replaced with commercial egg replacer and soy milk was used instead of cow's milk. Just note that Guiness is unfortunately not vegan because it has been refined with isinglass.

This is a less sweet version of baked beans with only a little molasses, more tomato-ey.  It's satisfying and simple.  If accompanied by a salad and some hearty bread it would probably be enough for 4 people.  For larger portions though, I'd say more like 2 or 3, with some leftovers.  The original recipe only called for 1 1/2 cups broth, I adjusted to 2 1/2, found it was too dry otherwise, but then I really like sauce so you may choose to cut that back down.  I also added 1 tbsp of brown sugar, found it was just lacking a little something without it.  The last adjustment was to the cooking time - originally calling for 40 mins at 350, that wasn't near enough time to even cook the onions, so I upped to 375 for an hour.

It's also yet another great way to use up the basil from your garden.  My husband and I were served this fabulous spread at a wonderful little Italian restaurant in Hot Springs, Arkansas called ""Bella Arte"" where we ate twice in 4 days during a trip there November 2001.  We asked the waiter for the recipe which is something we've never done before or since.  He wrote down the ingredients
(the little piece of paper is still taped to the inside of one of my kitchen cabinet doors), but didn't know the amounts which he said was up to the preparer. He also made it a point to say don't underestimate the importance of the roasted red peppers and using only fresh herbs.  The amounts I've listed are all approximate-you can easily adjust to your liking(and I know you will!) taste and texture-wise.  Mine never comes out quite the same twice, but we always love it and I serve it often when I have a group at the house.  Note-unless you like food really salty don't add any to this recipe.  There is plenty in the canned olives and the parmesan cheese. Process/pulse all the ingredients then add the olives(or at least 1 can) last if you want them to be chunkier and more rustic.  Otherwise, the food processor will turn this into a fairly smooth paste pronto.

The owners were originally from NY and worked in some of the top restaurants and gave it all up for FL life in the everglades. Well if you don't know where this place is, you WON'T find it - there is NO street name (a dirt road), NOT on the map, and it basically has NO name. Seafood, gater, burgers, sandwiches and chicken is about it, no steak, no soup, chili now and then -- but 5 star quality. Well, the day I was there I ordered a BLT. Well when it came out ... it wasn't like any BLT I ever had.  It was amazing but so different. Now being a Mom and Pop place in the everglades and 4 picnic tables, I knew I could talk to her and find out the crazy history behind this sandwich. So she sat down and told me the story. She said that is was not her traditional BLT, but she was forced to make some changes. Apparently, their delivery truck broke down so they didn't get their meat or produce. So she decided to improvise. Now, it still had tomatoes, bacon, mayo and lettuce, but this was the result. What a fantastic sandwich. It was served with both regular and sweet potato fries.

It really tastes best when you let it sit for a longer time, although you can get by with the short end of the range if you are in a hurry. I try to make it the night before and let it sit for about 24 hours. Since you don't knead it very much, bread flour wouldn't be a good choice--all-purpose works better for this recipe. Likewise, a bread machine wouldn't work well as it would overwork the dough. The original recipe stated crust can be used for either baked or grilled pizza, although I've never made grilled pizza and couldn't say how to do it. Prep times are estimates, and don't include rising or refrigeration times. NOTE: the ""dough enhancer"" listed in the ingredients is actually a dough improver, which relaxes the dough to allow for easier shaping of the dough. In addition, the recipe called for King Arthur Flour's pizza flavor (optional), which I am unable to list. It was just a crust flavor enhancer, containing cheese, garlic, and such.

11479,"Fabulous Vegetable Curry","READ THIS FIRST - IMPORTANT TIPS!!!  I got this recipe from a friend, and it is absolutely wonderful.  There are no Indian restaurants anywhere in the vicinity, so I had to find something to suffice - and this does the trick!!  It's great as a meal (with rice or whatever), and it's also wonderful as a dip to serve guests!

Special notes:  I would suggest getting the spices from an Indian food store, as they will be better and Indian chili powder is different from what you'd get at the grocery store.  Speaking of the chili powder, BE CAREFUL with it.  This recipe is very spicy AS IS.  I would suggest not increasing the amount unless you want your insides to be on fire.  As the recipe is, you'll need lots of water.  If anything, decrease the amount.  

Another thing - if you've never prepared eggplant (I hadn't prior to this recipe), you'll want to peel it, then slice it and salt both sides.  Then you'll leave the slices laying out on a paper towel for about 20 minutes to draw out the bitterness.  Ghee is clarified butter that you can purchase from an Indian food store, but you can substitute regular cooking oil.  Garam masala is a spice blend.  I'm not certain what's in it.  I bought a pre-made batch. :)  As for the vegetable base, it's optional, but I use Superior Touch ""Better than Bouillon"" veggie base.  You can also put in carrots if you like instead of chickpeas.

Yield is a TOTAL guess - I figure this fills about 2/3 of my 5 quart saute pan, and 3 quarts is 12 cups.  So there you go.","['ghee', 'vegetable stock base', 'chili powder', 'garam masala', 'ground coriander', 'fennel seed', 'onion', 'eggplant', 'potatoes', 'sweet peas', 'diced tomatoes', 'chickpeas', 'water', 'salt']",14

It has a rich, nutty flavour and a chewy texture, with a smooth, almost buttery mouth feel. It makes a perfect side dish to meat, poultry, or fish instead of potatoes, rice, or traditional pastas or couscous. It cooks in around 10 minutes by the absorption method – just like rice – and you can also use it in a variety of dishes – just like rice and other pastas.

The butter should be frozen solid before grating. In hot or humid environments, chill the flour mixture and workbowls before use. While the recipe calls for 2 whole sticks of butter, only 10 tablespoons are actually used (see step 1). If fresh berries are unavailable, an equal amount of frozen berries (do not defrost) can be substituted. An equal amount of raspberries, blackberries, or strawberries can be used in place of the blueberries. Cut larger berries into 1/4- to 1/2-inch pieces before incorporating. Refrigerate or freeze leftover scones, wrapped in foil, in an airtight container. To serve, remove foil and place scones on a baking sheet in a 375-degree oven. Heat until warmed through and recrisped, 8 to 10 minutes if refrigerated, 16 to 20 minutes if frozen. See final step for information on making the scone dough in advance.","['unsalted butter', 'blueberries', 'whole milk', 'sour cream', 'unbleached all-purpose flour', 'all-purpose flour', 'sugar', 'sugar', 'baking powder', 'baking soda', 'table salt', 'lemon zest']",12

Many benefits from eating watercress are claimed, such as that it acts as a mild stimulant, a source of phytochemicals and antioxidants, a diuretic, an expectorant, and a digestive aid. It also appears to have cancer-suppressing properties. It is widely believed to help defend against lung cancer. In addition, watercress is a known inhibitor of the Cytochrome P450 CYP2E1, which may result in altered drug metabolism for individuals on certain medications (ex., chlorzoxazone).""

Chili, to an aficionado, is more than a spicy stew; it is a  craving, a passion, for a simmered combination of meat and chile peppers  that warms the heart and inspires the soul.    The exact origin of chili is still shrouded in mystery. Some people believe it  wa  s originated by chuckwagon cooks who regularly prepared stew for the cowpokes  of the Southwest. Possibly, one of the these cooks ran out of black pepper and  in his search for a substitute, he came across some red chile peppers which were  common among the Indians and Mexicans in the territory that is now west Texas.  These undomesticated capsicums were extremely hot. When the cowboys inquired  about the source of the extreme heat, they were told that the heat came from the  ""chile"", or hot pepper. Over time, this sizzling stew became popular in its own  right, and became known as ""chili"".

13772,"Greek Lentil and Spinach Soup With Lemon","Adapted from ""The Dairy Hollow House Soup and Bread Cookbook"" by the indomitable Crescent Dragonwagon (not her birth name, obviously). I use a sweet potato instead of the butternut, as I am more likely to have those on hand and they are easier to peel and to scale down for fewer servings. I also use homemade chicken stock in lieu of veggie stock, as my freezer is always loaded with it, but you would get good results even with plain water. Use chard in place of spinach, if you like. Serve as an entree with a Greek salad and some good bread. NOTE: when I first made this, I weighed out a pound of mixed colors of lentils, in an effort to use some up. It came out VERY thick, like porridge, so I had to add extra liquid. For that reason, I recommend using less than the pound of lentils called for; somewhere between 1/2 and 3/4 pound should work well.","['lentils', 'vegetable stock', 'fresh jalapeno', 'coriander seeds', 'whole cumin seeds', 'dried oregano', 'dried basil', 'dried thyme', 'bay leaf', 'potatoes', 'fresh spinach', 'butternut squash', 'olive oil', 'onion', 'celery ribs', 'garlic cloves', 'salt', 'fresh lemon juice', 'lemon']",19

November 2008,   *If you can't get cracked stone-crab claws, you will need to crack them yourself!! Working with one crab claw at a time, wrap it in a kitchen towel.

16201,"French Cassoulet Maigre (Meaning Thin)","Each town has its own special version of this legendary dish.
 
I have eliminated most of the fat by omitting the unsmoked bacon or salt pork normally used.  I have also omitted the goose or duck fat that usually accompanies the traditional confit (preserved duck or goose.)  The fresh duck that I use in the recipe can be skinned to remove all fat, if desired.  The pork rind also found in other recipes has been omitted because it is not readily available in our markets.  Also omitted are the bread crumbs normally added during the last hour of cooking to absorb the excess fat and to form a crust.  Because I have omitted so much fat from the recipe, I have dubbed in maigre, meaning “thin.”
 
Although the purist may be skeptical of my omissions, I hope that you will consider the ease of preparation, the healthier, lowered fat content, and the wonderful flavors of the finished recipe when passing final judgment on my version.
 
The preparation of the cassoulet is divided into two procedures.  The beans are actually the recipe for Haricots a la Bretonne and should be made a day or two in advance.  And the cassoulet itself should be made one or two days ahead of time (an ideal dish for entertaining), because it tastes best when reheated.

16453,"Ww Taco Soup (Weight Watchers)","This is a slightly different version of Taco Soup for Weight Watchers. It has no meat so it is actually a vegetable soup. We served it for my mother in law and paired it with a salad and some rolls for the rest of the family. It was yummy. One caution it is spicy for some so if you don't like it spicy get the corn without the chilies. We used Lawry's taco seasoning and Hidden Valley Ranch ranch packet for the best flavor. We have no ties to them but love their products for this. It is warm and makes a lot of soup. We served 4 adults and two kids. Got this on a internet site awhile back. It is yummy but remember to JUDGE IT AS A WEIGHT WATCHER recipe because if you went hog wild with ingredients with more fat and calories it could be even better. Enjoy ChefDLH.

18261,"Garlic Soup That Cures What Ails You (Aka Hangover Soup)","This is my favorite garlic soup of all. It is wonderful and each bite is as memorable as the first. This garlic soup differs from the ordinary garlic soup as it is hearty but also elegant. It is the kind of soup a person craves when recovering from a cold or a broken heart. It has cured a number of hangovers over the years although scrawled above the recipe I have written “Do not attempt to make with a really really bad hangover!!!!” – and I heed that warning, so plan ahead (I am pretty sure it means not to make it with a real bad hangover if you have to also make the stock). The combination of garlic, herbs and cloves is magic; the tomato juice adds zip and the unctuous egg yolk enrichment is balanced by the pasta’s pleasant, soothing note. This will cure whatever ails you….For an even heartier entrée; place a poached egg on each croûte before ladling the soup over it. Wonderful! This soup is best when made with my Browned Vegetable Stock recipe (#150683), you could use other stock, but it would be a real shame…. a real shame…. so heighten your experience and make the stock as well… you won’t be sorry. For a fine-but-not-fussy meal you’ll be proud to set before anyone, try this soup with THE Salad (“the” Salad Recipe #150702) … because you can never have too much garlic! LOL! Finish with a fruity dessert like a really good baked apple made with brown sugar and served with gingerbread and a dollop of yogurt….. yummy!","['heads of garlic', 'vegetable stock', 'whole cloves', 'dried sage', 'dried leaf thyme', 'parsley', 'pepper', 'tomato juice', 'orzo pasta', 'egg yolks', 'garlic bread', 'sharp cheddar cheese', 'fresh parsley', 'avocado']",14

Two notes: 1) the original dish was meant to be 'Saatvic' (a type of Hindu food considered pure), which usually means no onions or garlic, but it is tasty both ways and; 2) the recipe calls for jaggery, which can be bought in a local Indian grocer, but sugar works almost as well.","['mung beans', 'onion', 'green chilies', 'ginger', 'cumin seed', 'mustard seeds', 'lime%2c juice of', 'lime', 'cilantro', 'jaggery', 'canola oil', 'coriander powder', 'salt']",13

While the soup base simmers, prepare wild rice, and saute your fresh mushrooms. This is where you can really be creative with different types of mushrooms, like my fave, Hen of the Woods, AKA Maitake, which adds an intense earthiness and an interesting texture. Once the soup base has simmered, add in your light cream and blend with an immersion blender. Add in your sauteed mushrooms, wild rice, and oysters.The base and the wild rice can be made ahead.

I use 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 c unbleached white flour (to make the 3 cups of flour the bread bowls call for) to make this a little healthier.
